# PyMADS: Phase 1 Setup and Analysis

Welcome to the PyMADS documentation! This project aims to convert the Mad-Assembler (MADS) from Pascal to Python while maintaining compatibility with existing projects and improving code maintainability.

## Project Overview

PyMADS is a Python port of the Mad-Assembler (MADS), a 6502/65816 cross-assembler originally written in Pascal. The goal is to create a more maintainable and extensible version while ensuring binary compatibility with the original.

## Key Features

- **Compatibility**: Generates identical binary output to the original MADS
- **Maintainability**: Modern Python codebase with clear documentation
- **Extensibility**: Designed for easy feature additions and improvements
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite to ensure compatibility

## Development Approach

The development follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup and Initial Analysis (Current)
2. **Phase 2**: Core Engine Translation
3. **Phase 3**: Feature Completion
4. **Phase 4**: Testing and Refinement

## Getting Started
